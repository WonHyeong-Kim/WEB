				play you say. Ok, well before we get into the part where floats usher
				in a world of bacon-loving unicorns, let’s back up for a second to
				talk about what’s actually happening here. In the web world, our HTML
				is bound by some rules, in particular, the normal flow. In the normal
				flow, each block element (div, p, h1, etc.) stacks on top of each
				other vertically, from the top of the viewport down. Floated elements
				are first laid out according to the normal flow, then taken out of the
				normal flow and sent as far to the right or left (depending on which
				value is applied) of the parent element. In other words, they go from
				stacking on top of each other to sitting next to each other, given
				that there is enough room in the parent element for each floated
				element to sit. This behavior is crucial to remember as you build your
				websites.</p>

			<p>The float property is a valuable and powerful asset to any web
				designer/developer working with HTML and CSS. Tragically, it can also
				cause frustration and confusion if you don’t fully understand how it
				works. Also, in the past, it’s been linked to some pretty nasty
				browser bugs so it's normal to get nervous about using the float
				property in your CSS rule sets. Let’s calm those nerves and ease that
				frustration. I’ll show you exactly what the float property does to
				your elements and how incredibly useful it can be once you master it.
			</p>
			<p>We see floats in the print world every time we pick up a
				magazine article with an image on the left or right with text flowing
				nicely around it. In the world of HTML/CSS, text will wrap around an
				image with the float property applied to it, much like in a magazine
				layout. Images are just one of the many use cases for the float
				property: we can also achieve the popular two-column layout using
				floats. In fact, you can float just about any element in your HTML. By
				learning and understanding float property basics, along with position
				property basics, you will be able to achieve any layout with
				confidence.</p>
			<p>The float property has four values that we can apply to it:
				left, right, inherit, and none. Each value is pretty self explanatory.
				For example, if you assign float: left to an element, it will move to
				the left-most boundary of its parent element. The same idea applies if
				you were to assign float: right; to an element. That element would be
				sent off to the right-most boundary of its parent element. The inherit
				value tells an element to inherit the float value of its parent
				element. The value none is the default value and tells an element not
				to float at all.</p>
